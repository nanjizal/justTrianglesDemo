# justTrianglesDemo
WebGL Test code for ' justTriangles'

There are 4 small dependancies **justTriangles**, **justTriangesWebGL**, **htmlHelper** and **khaMath**. I have added an hxml file that installs and compiles project to save you some effort:

[installCompile.hxml](https://github.com/nanjizal/justTrianglesDemo/blob/master/installCompile.hxml)

If you install this as a haxelib, you can experiment with drawing by just extending the Demo and overriding the draw method with new draw functionality.
